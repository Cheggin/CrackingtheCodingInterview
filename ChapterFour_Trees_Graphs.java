    /* 
    Notes for memorization:
    
    Complete binary tree: every level is fully filled besides the lowest level, where there can be some missing(right side only bc nodes are added left to right)
    
    full binary tree: every node has 0 or 2 children(aka no solo nodes)
    
    Breadth-First search: search every node that is connected to the current node, then go on; better for SHORTEST PATH(though dijkstra's is probably better...? or A* I forgot which one is which)
    
    Depth-first search: start at root/arbitrary node and continued until a node has no connections going out of it, then go backwards...? ; better for VISITING EVERY NODE
